About the app

Developed using Visual Studio 2015, update 3, in C# using SQL Server
The actual database is a SQL Server MDF file, contained within the project.  It was created usign SQL Server 2012

When I tested this on a different computer (than where developed), there was initially a problem with the version of SQL Server LocalDB

If you get a runtime error indicating that " the database ... cannot be opened ...", try these instructions.
